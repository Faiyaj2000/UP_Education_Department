<p>Education is a very powerful and effective medium. It is a universally accepted principle that everyone should be well educated and strive to do welfare of the people. Education is the cornerstone of intellectual prosperity and national self-reliance.

    Image of About Us
    Till the year 1972, the education of primary, secondary, higher and training level was operational under the Director of Education. With increasing work in education and with the aim of efficient operation of schools and new experiments to make the programs more dynamic and effective, it was decided to bifurcate the Directorate of Education into three sections in the year 1972, under which the Director of Education (Basic), Director of Education (Secondary) and Director of Education (Higher) posts were created. In 1975, Basic and Secondary Education were integrated, while the Higher Education Department continued separately. In the year 1985, to make Basic Education more effective and dynamic, a separate Directorate of Basic Education was established.
    
    Separate directorates to make research programs more dynamic and effective have been set up in the state along with directorates such as primary education, Urdu and oriental languages, State Council of Educational Research and Training, Literacy and Alternative Education, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Mid-Day Meal Authority.
    
    The Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Council was constituted on 25-7-1972 for the work of accreditation and general control of private schools related to primary education. For the supervision of such schools, posts of Divisional Assistant Director of Education (Basic) at the divisional level, Basic Education Officers at the district level and Block Education Officers at the block level were created. Accounts department was also established in the Basic Education Council in the year 1986 for the distribution of salaries of teachers / non-teaching employees working in council schools, maintenance of the amount of General Provident Fund and payment of retirement benefits. Under this, posts of the Finance and Accounts Officer (Basic Education) of the districts and Finance Controller, Basic Education were established at the headquarters of the council.

    To achieve the goal of universalization of primary education, well-planned programs are being conducted to expand access to education, increase gross enrollment ratio and improve the quality of education.
    
    Under the Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 45 of the Constitution, a system was made that by adopting the Constitution, free and compulsory education would be provided to all boys/girls in the age group of 6-14 years within 10 years. Since the time when the National Policy on Education was formulated in the year 1986, there has been a lot of improvement especially in the field of primary education till now. Under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, various programs are being run by the state government, giving top priority to all the children of 6-14 years age group to provide education from class 1 to 8. Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the state government has set the standard of setting up primary school facilities. For every 300 population and 01 km distance, a primary school and 01 upper primary school at a distance of 03 km and 800 population has been established.
    
    In view of the need for mutual co-ordination, administrative control, supervision and consolidated data analysis among all the directorates established in the Basic Education Department and for the purpose of financial control/administrative control in the 05 directorates formed under the Basic Education Department and speedy implementation of important schemes of the department, the post of Director General, School Education (DGSE) was constituted in the year 2019 with the aim of implementation and qualitative improvement in the level of primary education and increasing the efficiency of teachers.</p>
