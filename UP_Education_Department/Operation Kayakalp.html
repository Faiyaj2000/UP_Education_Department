    <h3>Operation Kayakalp:</h3>
    <p>School, the place where the future of the country is shaped, where the foundation for a better future of our future generations i.e. our children is laid. Schools are the most important centers of personality development of children. In such a situation, it is very important to improve the basic facilities and infrastructural conditions in government primary and upper primary schools.

        In June 2018, one of India's largest inter-departmental convergence programs 'Operation Kayakalp' was launched by the Government of Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of Hon'ble Chief Minister. Under this, funds have been specially made available by the Central and State Government for various initiatives like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Gram Panchayat Fund, District Mineral Fund, various funds of urban area, Jal Jeevan Mission, MNREGA etc. The basic infrastructural facilities of upper primary schools are being revamped. It has been only about three years since 'Operation Kayakalp' started, but within this short period, the work of rejuvenation has started in every school in the state in a phased manner. Schools have been renovated on a large scale in each district.
        
        For the authenticity and transparency of the work of rejuvenation, geo-tagging is being done under the photo protocol of each school. Real time monitoring of the saturation of these works is also being done continuously through Prerna portal. As a result, Operation Kayakalp has given a new look to the schools of villages and towns located hundreds of kilometres away. Significant changes have now taken place in hundreds of schools in the state. These schools have digital class rooms with gates, boundary walls, floor tiles, play parks and libraries, separate toilets for boys and girls, handwash systems for drinking water and hand washing, classrooms for children. After getting the facility of furniture, the smiles and happiness on the faces of the children studying here are telling the success story of rejuvenation. The activism of headmasters, teachers and members of SMC has converted these schools into the category of the most beautiful schools of the state and these schools have become ideal for the people of the village.
        
        By improving 19 basic facilities, primary and upper primary schools on a large scale have been developed as the most ideal buildings (with 5-star ratings) of Gram Sabha and as Adarsh Vidyalaya. In this sequence, special care is being taken for handicap accessibility. Keeping in mind the safety of children from the Covid epidemic, special attention is being paid to the construction of handwashing units in all the schools of the state.
        
        The technical manual prepared in collaboration with UNICEF for the development and construction of child friendly and disabled accessible facilities in schools has played a very important role in technical and practical training and capacity building of masons, teachers, village heads etc.
        
        In this way, with the invaluable cooperation of District Magistrates, Chief Development Officers, Basic Education Department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department, Urban Development Department, etc., village heads and teachers of various districts in the state, the schools of rural areas have become ideal schools. Schools in urban areas are also being changed. Operation Kayakalp is a symbol of a historic change being made in the field of education. Through this, it is targeted to convert all government primary and upper primary schools of the state into ideal schools by August 2022. After the rejuvenation, there has been a record increase in the number of students in these schools. 1.66 crore boys and girls studying in council schools of the state and their parents have become confident about the changes brought about by Operation Kayakalp. They now believe that their dreams will definitely come true.</p>
